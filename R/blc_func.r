#' @title Baseline correction
#'
#' @description
#' Generates the baseline of the spectra, interpolates between points, and subtracts from the intensity to generate corrected baseline.
#'
#' @param frame data frame of time versus intensity.
#' @param noise strength of the baseline subtraction.
#' @param subtract how much intensity to initially subtract.
#'
#' @return data frame of of data that has been baseline corrected
