#'
#' @description `MethodOpt()` runs the GUI.
#'
#' @details
#' No arguments are needed to initiate the GUI. `MethodOpt()` is split into three main tabs.
#'
#' @section Fractional factorial design:
#' The first step in method optimization is to build an experimental design. Hence,
#' the first tab of the GUI is dedicated to designing a fractional factorial experimental design.
#' Parameters are input with their corresponding low and high values. Pressing "Generate FFD" will
#' yield the experimental design. The user will run experiments according to each method.
#'
#' @section ANOVA:
#' The second step in method optimization is to run an ANOVA test. This is carried out
#' under the "Analysis" tab. Raw experimental screening data is uploaded, and the spectra
#' can be viewed. In subtabs, the spectra peaks must be identified (either by an uploaded retention time
#' file or by a built-in identification algorithm), objectives must be selected, and the initial
#' experimental design must be uploaded; then the ANOVA test may be run.
#' Statistically significant parameters are indicated.
#'
#' @section Box-Behnken design:
#' The third step is to generate a three-level Box-Behnken experimental design with the
#' significant parameters. Low, middle, and high values are input with their corresponding
#' parameters. The design can be generated by pressing "Generate BBD."
#'
#' @section Optimization:
#' The final step is to run the optimization with the results of the Box-Behnken design.
#' Similarly to the second step, raw data is uploaded in the "Analysis" tab. Spectra peaks
#' must be identified, objectives
#' must be selected, and the experimental design must be uploaded; then the optimal
#' values can be calculated.
#'
#' @return {No return value, opens and runs the GUI}
#'
#' @examples
#' # Please see the vignette for the MethodOpt package for a full example of how
#' # to use the GUI launched by MethodOpt::MethodOpt().

#' @export
